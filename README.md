# Obesity Classifier with Flask

This is a web application that uses a Support Vector Machine algorithm to predict the obesity level of an individual based on their lifestyle choices. The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework.

## Purpose of this Application

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool to predict the obesity level of an individual based on their lifestyle choices. This can be helpful in identifying individuals who may be at risk for obesity and may benefit from lifestyle modifications to improve their health.
